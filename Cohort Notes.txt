SSD stores everything whichb is not running.
RAM stores everything which is running. everything goes to RAM in the form of 0's and 1's after compilation. Compiler converts developer language to 0's and 1's as machine understands only 0's and 1's.

Scripting vs Compiled languages
In c++ it will compile the whole thing convert it into other file and run it

JS is a interpreted language. We need not compile such languages. It will run like by line.Code will run partially if error comes later

Why JS> Other scripting languages
Most of the browsers understand JS
Because of Node.js we can also use js for backend development

Strict vs dynamic languages
C++ is a strict language. We can't change type of a same variable. If we initialise a variable with particular type then we can't change the type of the variable.
JS is a dynamic language as we can change type of variables in the code

JS is a single threaded language
It can run only one use one core at a time
it is considered as a bad language for scalable systems

Variables in JS
Let,var and const
const cannot be changed throughout the program

Datatypes: number, string and boolean

IF/ELSE

For loops

Arrays

Objects

Functions - take arguments as i/p returns o/p
Functions can take other functions as i/p

setTimeout takes a function as input and callls the function provided as input after a period of time.

Synch4ronous - one at a time
Asynchronous - multiple things are context switching with each other

Async functions in js - setTimeout, fs.readFile,fetch
