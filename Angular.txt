Angular

Typescript: It is JS+Typing
Normally in Js we don't define a type of a variable but in typescript we should define the type of the variable


ANGULAR CLI helps us to create angular applications and also helps us to write a lot of code while developing Angular applications.
It helps us to run our code locally and also run our integration tests, unit tests
Angular CLI is like a Maven plugin

To create a Angular project you can give ng new in command prompt after installing Angular CLI
Intial code required for Angular CLI can be generated using ng generate
ng build - to build you code
ng lint - to run your code quality checks
ng run - to run the applications
ng test - to run the unit tests
ng e2e - to run end to end tests
ng serve - When you make any code change the change would be automatically picked up by your application

ng serve is used to start your application

ng lint - it will check your code for coding standards
The coding standard will be present in tslint.json

ng build - > before running ng build we need to run this command set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
When you run ng build it will create a new dist folder. There will be a few files present in there. We can directly launch the index.html 
and run the entire application.
We don't need any of the other code to launch the application
When we deploy angular applications to production we need to execute ng dist it makes it easy to deploy the applications to other environments
For that we need to copy the appplication to a webserver

Unittests for angular are writter in a framework called jasmine and we will use karma to run the unit test

These tests are defines in karma.conf.js
Other than this there are many files for the specs
the file will be .spec.ts

ng e2e -> it is end to end test it will launch total application
In angular e2e tests are written in a framework called protactor

Angular.json defines what should happen when we run specific commands
