Monolithic application:
We have everything in one place i.e., all the services in one place. You can keep everything in a package and deploy it.
With this there will be team dependency, scalability issue
We need to stick to one technology because of this.

Using Microservices we can build each service using different language.
As they are in different services even if any service goes down it doesn't effect application

Using API we can connect between different services.
They will have HTTP Servers and endpoints to communicate 


REST API
API is something that connects you to the server.
We will send a request to server and the server returns response

A REST API is an application programming Interface that follows the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services

REST API work over HTTP
Delivers information using any one of the following format
JSON
HTML
XML
tEXT
