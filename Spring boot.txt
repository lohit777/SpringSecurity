Add spring web dependency to build spring boot rest api through spring initialiser
Once spring boot project is created and we launch that application it will be launched in tomcat server.

<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>


these 2 are responsible for adding all the maven dependencies


Goal of spring boot
Spring boot helps us to build production ready applications quickly
Below applications are helpful in building spring projects quickly
Spring Intialiser - it helps to easily create spring projects
Spring boot starter projects - it helps to quickly define dependencies to projects
Spring boot dev tools  - this will help to make application changes without having to manually restart the server
Spring boot auto configuration - it will automatically provide configuration based on the dependencies in the classpath


Production Ready -> spring boot provides a number of features to get our application production ready like below:
default loggings
different configuration for different environment
 -profiles, configuration properties
monitoring(spring boot actuator) -> we can monitor the application like memory etc

Spring boot starter projects -
We need a lot of frameworks to build application features
